# Quora Questions Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling

We first analyze the sentiment of the entire Quora dataset of questions (400K questions) openly released by
Quora for the Kaggle Pairs Question challenge. We then break up the sentiment into highly negatively sentiment
text and the entire dataset and compare Topic Modeling on both data sets using Latent Dirichilet Allocation
and view our results via visualizations from the PyLDAvis library. Afterwards, we make a conclusion based on our
findings.
